# SoccerBot
The Arduino Powered Soccer Bot project, which won second place in the TMU Premier League Contest, is housed in this repository! All of the code and documentation required to comprehend and construct the robot are contained in this repository.

The basic parts of our robot, including the Arduino Uno microcontroller, simple servo motors, and a chassis, were supplied by a standard Arduino bot kit. Although this kit served as the foundation for our project, we had to modify it to satisfy the unique needs of a robot that could play soccer.

The creation and construction of a unique front bracket was essential to the Soccer Bot's success. This part was necessary to hold the soccer ball firmly and guarantee dependable interactions while playing. Our Soccer Bot's ability to rotate 360 degrees without changing its position on the field is one of its most notable features. With careful coding and motor control, this functionality was made possible.
